The Smart home energy network has gained widespread attentions due to its flexible integration into everyday life. This next generation green home system transparently unifies various home appliances, smart sensors and wireless communication technologies. The green home energy network gradually forms a complex system to process various tasks. Developing this trend, we suggest a new Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) based on an IEEE802.15.4 and ZigBee (we call it as a \"ZigBee sensor network\"). The proposed smart home energy management system divides and assigns various home network tasks to appropriate components. It can integrate diversified physical sensing information and control various consumer home devices, with the support of active sensor networks having both sensor and actuator components. We develop a new routing protocol DMPR (Disjoint Multi Path based Routing) to improve the performance of our ZigBee sensor networks. This paper introduces the proposed home energy control system's design that provides intelligent services for users. We demonstrate its implementation using a real environment.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, such as smart-bulbs, smoke-alarms, webcams, and health-monitoring devices, is accompanied by escalating threats of attacks that can seriously compromise household and personal safety. Recent works have advocated the use of network-level solutions to detect and prevent attacks on smart-home IoT devices. In this paper we undertake a deeper exploration of network-level security solutions for IoT, by comparing flow-based monitoring with packet-based monitoring approaches. We conduct experiments with real attacks on real IoT devices to validate our flow-based security solution, and use the collected traces as input to simulations to compare its processing performance against a packet-based solution. Our results show that flow-based monitoring can achieve most of the security benefits of packet-based monitoring, but at dramatically reduced processing costs. Our study informs the design of future smart-home network-level security solutions.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, there is an ever-increasing migration of people to urban areas. Health care service is one of the most challenging aspects that is greatly affected by the vast influx of people to city centers. Consequently, cities around the world are investing heavily in digital transformation in an effort to provide healthier ecosystems for people. In such a transformation, millions of homes are being equipped with smart devices (e.g., smart meters, sensors, and so on), which generate massive volumes of fine-grained and indexical data that can be analyzed to support smart city services. In this paper, we propose a model that utilizes smart home big data as a means of learning and discovering human activity patterns for health care applications. We propose the use of frequent pattern mining, cluster analysis, and prediction to measure and analyze energy usage changes sparked by occupants' behavior. Since people's habits are mostly identified by everyday routines, discovering these routines allows us to recognize anomalous activities that may indicate people's difficulties in taking care for themselves, such as not preparing food or not using a shower/bath. This paper addresses the need to analyze temporal energy consumption patterns at the appliance level, which is directly related to human activities. For the evaluation of the proposed mechanism, this paper uses the U.K. Domestic Appliance Level Electricity data set-time series data of power consumption collected from 2012 to 2015 with the time resolution of 6 s for five houses with 109 appliances from Southern England. The data from smart meters are recursively mined in the quantum/data slice of 24 h, and the results are maintained across successive mining exercises. The results of identifying human activity patterns from appliance usage are presented in detail in this paper along with the accuracy of shortand long-term predictions.",

        "abstract": "As the progress of wireless communication technology, WLAN and Zigbee are more frequently utilized in our apartments. Because of using the same frequency band, radio interferences will more or less impact on the Zigbee network for its characteristic of low-power consumption. In this paper with smart home as context, an interferences analysis between Zigbee and WLAN is suggested. A series of tests was to explore the relation between apartments and performance of Zigbee system. Then a hybrid network smart home base on Zigbee and smart plugs is proposed to avoid the shortcomings of radio interferences of pure Zigbee network. Compare with pure Zigbee smart home, smart home base on Zigbee and smart plugs uses power line communications (PLC) as backbone network to transmit data.",

        "abstract": "Gesture recognition is playing a vital role in human-computer interaction and smart home automation. Conventional gesture recognition systems require either dedicated extra infrastructure to be deployed or users to carry wearable and mobile devices, which is high-cost and intrusive for large-scale implementation. In this paper, we propose FreeGesture, a device-free gesture recognition scheme that can automatically identify common gestures via deep learning using only commodity WiFi-enabled IoT devices. A novel OpenWrt-based IoT platform is developed so that the fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) measurements can be obtained directly from IoT devices. Since these measurements are time-series data, we consider them as continuous RF images and construct CSI frames with both amplitudes and phase differences as features. We design a dedicated convolutional neural network (CNN) to uncover the discriminative local features in these CSI frames and construct a robust classifier for gesture recognition. All the parameters in CNN are automatically fine-tuned end-to-end. Experiments are conducted in a typical office and the results validate that FreeGesture achieves a 95.8 percent gesture recognition accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has been widely used in the consumer field for control of smart home personal assistants, with many such devices on the market. However, with the increase in computational power, connectivity, and the need to enable people to live in the home for longer though the use of technology, then smart home assistants that could detect human emotion will improve the communication between a user and the assistant enabling the assistant of offer more productive feedback. Thus, the aim of this work is to analyze emotional states in speech and propose a suitable method considering performance verses complexity for deployment in Consumer Electronics home products, and to present a practical live demonstration of the research. In this article, a comprehensive approach has been introduced for the human speech-based emotion analysis. The 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN) has been implemented to learn and classify the emotions associated with human speech. The paper has been implemented on the standard datasets (emotion classification) Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) and Toronto Emotional Speech Set database (TESS) (Young and Old). The proposed approach gives 90.48 percent, 95.79 percent and 94.47 percent classification accuracies in the aforementioned datasets. We conclude that the 1-D CNN classification models used in speaker-independent experiments are highly effective in the automatic prediction of emotion and are ideal for deployment in smart home assistants to detect emotion.",

        "abstract": "Thanks to the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT), the research and the implementation of home automation are getting more popular because the IoT holds promise for making homes smarter through wireless technologies. There is a main requirement that make a wireless protocol ideal for use in the IoT, that is the energy efficiency. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has a high potential in becoming an important technology for the IoT in low power, low cost, small devices. However, specific techniques can be used in such a way as to further reduce the energy consumption of BLE. To this end, this paper proposes a fuzzy logic based mechanism that determine the sleeping time of field devices in a home automation environment based on BLE. The proposed FLC determines the sleeping time of field devices according to the battery level and to the ratio of Throughput to Workload (Th/Wl). Simulation results reveal that using the proposed approach the device lifetime is increased by 30 percent with respect to the use of fixed sleeping time.",

        "abstract": "The complex and invisible services in smart home can lead to the difficulty in occupant role over the whole smart home life-cycle beginning from the design process to the occupancy stage. As any smart home will be eventually used by end users, providing a method to enhance user participation and user comprehension on how smart equipments and service will be installed as well as be operated is indispensable. Nonetheless, there is no research which applies the user-centered approach on the smart home design stage so far. This paper is focused on how to create and to implement virtual space using virtual reality technology as a platform to simulate smart home service configuration. A new framework comprises Spatial Context-aware Place Data Model, Place and Avatar Agents, and Web Service is firstly introduced in this paper. By means of context-aware building data model, human\u2013space interaction which is vital for simulating smart home functions and services are realized in the virtual environment. Together with VR, the platform is capable of visualizing invisible services, performing real-time interactions with the home, and acknowledging the users how it can be configured and operated according to their individual needs. In addition, the web-based service increases the system accessibility and usability as users can log-in from anywhere to collaborate with each others. Because smart home is extremely difficult for users to gain insight of smart service configuration, our research position is to express a user-oriented approach by applying the concept of U-VR to smart home simulation model.",
